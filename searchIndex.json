Some parts can negate others.\n\nZero Trust\nDont trust anyone, not even yourself. Always check, and consistently check. Assumes no device should be trusted by default\n\nUsers only receive access to resources they need\nAlways verify\nDesign network assuming attackers are already inside our network\n\nInitially networks used trust but verify\n\nAuthentication: Who are you?\nAuthentication is the process of verifying someones identity\nMethods:\n\nSomething you know\n\nPassword\n\nSomething you have\n\nCode from app\nUSB token\n\nSomething you are (Biometrics)\n\nFingerprint\nFace scan\n\nMulti-Factor authentication should be required to authenticate.\n\nAuthorization: What can you do:\nAuthorization determines what resources or actions a person is allowed to access\nTypes\n\nRole-based Access Control (RBAC):\nAccess based on job role\nAttribute-based Access Control (ABAC):\nAccess based on the person’s attributes and conditions\n\nDefense In Depth\nA multi-layered approach to security controls\n\nEnsures that if one security measure fails, there ate others in place behind it\nMinimizes likelihood of breach\nGives time to launch countermeasures against an attack\n\nIdeally Network monitoring will be in place\n\nMain Ideas and Takeaways\n\nHuman Factors\nHumans are the weakest link\n\nbetween 68% to 95% of cyber incidents are caused by human error\nSocial engineering attacks\n\nPhishing\nPretexting\nBaiting\n\nLack of awareness &amp; training\n\nNot knowing what to do when a problem occurs\n\nBad password hygiene or authentication\n\nWeak passwords\n\nBad communication\n\nUser not reporting something suspicious\nUsers should feel safe to report suspicious activity\n\nThe Cybersecurity Mindset\nHaving a cybersecurity mindset is about more than stopping attackers\n\nPrepared, alert, and ethical\nAware of their online presence and digital footprint\nAlways learning new technology, tools, or exploits\n\nRead security blogs\nKeep up to date with tech news\nPracticing labs\n\nSlides",
